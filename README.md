## Data Reports Folder
### AnalyzingHateCrimeData.pdf
In this project, we, as a group, investigated the hate crime data across multiple official data sources.
### FoodSecurityData.pdf
In this report, I looked into the demographics of food access (income, distance, age, race...), the geographic distriburion, and its correlation with poverty. Moreover, I proposed a simple solution. The project was for a data science course, and there was a page limit. That's why all the graphs are clumped together. Also, the main focus of the project was to investigate and not visualize. 
### creating_misleading_visualizations.pdf
In this project, it was asked from us to create two visualizations, yet one of them had to obscure the facts in the data, and the other visualization should have represent the data truthfully. 
### disney_movie_market
In this report, I analyzed and visalized Disney's movie patterns and tried to explain why we see a change in their movie patterns.

# Practices
Individual or class projects conducted on Python, R, HTML, and SQL
## basic_python_practices.py:
Practice with dictionaries using basic built-in Python commands
#### Question 1: 
Given a string printing the word count
#### Question 2:
Given a dictionary, find the frequency of specified strings
#### Question 3:
Finding panagrams and missing letters
#### Question 4:
Practicing list comprehensions
#### Question 5:
Practicing calling the dictionary keys and values
## trees_and_classes.py:
Practicing basic Python classes and building trees using classes
## record_linkage.py:
Practicing tuples and classes. Using two different datasets, created a class to match the common values in the two datasets by calcualting a match / unmatch probability
## webapge_crawler.py:
Practicing with the BeautifulSoup package. Created a web page crawler: the code starts with an initial link from the University of Chicago course catalogue 
and creates course and relative key word pairings from the course's title and description. Code continues until completing every course listed by opening the relative links found on the initial and crawled webpages.
## python_class_practices.py:
Re-creating the University of Chicago course registration system by practicing Python classes
## pytorch_bert_nlp.ipynb:
practicing with Pytorch packages and Bert models
## bert_base_uncased.ipynb:
Practicing with Bert Base Uncased (freezing some of its layers) and basic NLP models
## data_visualization1.ipynb:
Practicing data visualization with Seaborn, Altair, and Matplotlib
